# AwaSabi  
### Design and Implementation of a Multilingual Learning System for Nigerian Local Languages

---

## 🌍 What is AwaSabi?

**AwaSabi** is a multilingual learning platform designed to help Nigerians and Africans reconnect with their indigenous languages through technology.

The name **AwaSabi** reflects the soul of the project:

- **“Awa”** comes from **AWARRI**, whose N-ATLaS large language model powers the intelligence behind the system.
- **“Sabi”** is Nigerian Pidgin for *knowledge* or *understanding*.

Together, **AwaSabi** means **African intelligence meets local knowledge** — a platform built to preserve language, culture, and identity.

---

## 📘 Project Summary

Many Nigerian languages are gradually fading as younger generations grow up speaking only English. While platforms like Duolingo make it easy to learn Spanish or French, there is no equivalent solution for Nigerian languages such as Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, or Ibibio.

**AwaSabi** bridges this gap.

It is an AI-powered learning system that helps users learn, understand, and confidently speak Nigerian local languages. Beyond language learning, AwaSabi promotes cultural preservation, identity, and pride by embedding learning in real-world Nigerian contexts.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Growing up, many Nigerian families emphasized speaking perfect English as a marker of success. As a result, local languages were often sidelined.

For many people, especially those in the diaspora this meant losing the ability to speak their mother tongue. Even when parents later attempted to teach it, the opportunity had already passed.

AwaSabi exists to answer one question:

> *What if learning Yoruba, Hausa, or Ibibio was as easy as opening Duolingo?*
